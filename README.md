# K-Means
K-Means clustering algorithm in iris data for petal length and petal width.

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science.K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.

It is an iterative algorithm that divides the unlabeled dataset into k different clusters in such a way that each dataset belongs only one group that has similar properties.
It allows us to cluster the data into different groups and a convenient way to discover the categories of groups in the unlabeled dataset on its own without the need for any training.
It is a centroid-based algorithm, where each cluster is associated with a centroid. The main aim of this algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the data point and their corresponding clusters.

The k-means clustering algorithm mainly performs two tasks:
--> Determines the best value for K center points or centroids by an iterative process.
--> Assigns each data point to its closest k-center. Those data points which are near to the particular k-center, create a cluster.
